A Lattice cluster with Heat
==============================

This project is inspired by the [docker-swarm heat](https://github.com/openstack/magnum/tree/master/magnum/templates/docker-swarm) projectï¼Œand imitates it. I am planning to integreate it to the Magnum project, keep it similar with the style may help.

These [Heat][] templates will deploy an *N*-node Lattice cluster,
where *N* is the value of the `number_of_nodes` parameter you
specify when creating the stack.

heat: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat

Lattice: http://lattice.cf/index.html

## Requirements

### OpenStack

These templates will work with the Juno version of Heat. And:

1. External network should be pre-created;
2. SSH Key should be pre-created. 

### Guest image

These templates will work with Ubuntu 14.04 Cloud Image, which can be downloaded from: http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/trusty/current/ . 

## Creating the stack

Creating an environment file `local.yaml` with parameters specific to
your environment:

    parameters:
      ssh_key_name: lattice
      external_network_id: 028d70dd-67b8-4901-8bdd-0c62b06cce2d
      dns_nameserver: 10.32.105.133
      server_image: ubuntu-14.04
      number_of_nodes: 10
      lattice_tar_url: http://10.32.105.222/lattice.tgz
      
Parameters: 

* ssh_key_name: The name of precreated SSH key;
* external_network_id: The ID of precreated external network;
* dns_nameserver: Optional paramters, set if your enviroment cannot use 8.8.8.8
* server_image: The name of Ubuntu Cloud Image;
* number_of_nodes: Optional parameters, it is 3 by default. The number of Lattice cells will be added to the cluster;
* lattice_tar_url: Optional parameters, considering we may build Lattice ourself, we can put our build in FTP, or HTTP server. 
* lattice_username: Optional parameters, default is "user".
* lattice_password: Optional parameters, default is "password".

We use "wget" to fetch the images. By default, we will download from: https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/lattice/unstable/latest/lattice.tgz .

And more optional parameter, please check from [lattice.yaml](https://github.com/LaynePeng/heat-lattice/blob/master/lattice.yaml)

And then create the stack, referencing that environment file:

    heat stack-create -f lattice.yaml -e local.yaml my-lattice-cluster

## Interacting with Lattice

Please follow the guide in [Lattice Get Started](http://lattice.cf/docs/getting-started.html). 

The target is the floating IP of coordinator node with the domain you set (xio.io by default). For example, suppose the floating IP is 10.32.80.133, then please run:

    ltc target 10.32.80.133.xip.io
    ltc vz
    
You should see the cells have been added to Lattice clusters.
